# FLAMES-using-Arrays
The FLAMES Java program predicts relationships based on two names using the FLAMES game logic. It collects names and gender input, identifies unique character occurrences, and applies an elimination process to determine the relationship: Friends, Lovers, Arranged Marriage, Marriage, Enemies, or Siblings.
